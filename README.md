# PersonalizedCookbook

Personalized Cookbook is an Android App that allows the user to input their own recipes that they enjoy, and retrieve at a later time.

The user has meal categories of Breakfast, Lunch, Dinner, Dessert, Drinks and Snacks where they can add recipes into.  

When adding in recipes, typing out the instructions can be tedious if the recipes instructions are long.  This app allows the user to copy instructions from one place, and paste it into the app for easier adding.

If the user were to make a mistake with a recipes name, ingredients or instructions, there is an edit feature, so they can edit the parts that they need, instead of starting over.
Were the recipe to be placed into the wrong category, the user can move the recipe from one category to another.  Or they can delete the recipe if they find they no longer want it.

Recipes are stored in a SQLite Database, with AutoBackup enabled in the app.  If the user has the Auto Backup feature enabled on their phone, the Database will be stored on their Google Account, and can be retrieved if they get a new device.
